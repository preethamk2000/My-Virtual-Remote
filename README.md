# My-Virtual-Remote
An android app with a less fluid UI but does what it is supposed to do; a remote to your pc

Basically, what happens is that you need to run a simple java server on your pc and connect the app on your android device to this server (via a hotspot or a common wifi n/w) and then you can control basic functionalities like the keyboard and mouse without touching your pc.

ServerforRemote --> needs to run on pc

Other Main activity java files are part of the android app
